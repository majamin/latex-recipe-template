# README

This is a simple LaTeX recipe template.

Use `recipes/example.tex` as a template to create your own recipe, then add it to `main.tex`.

## Building

You'll need a distribution like texlive, with the usual fonts packages.

A simple command like `lualatex main.tex` should build the document.
